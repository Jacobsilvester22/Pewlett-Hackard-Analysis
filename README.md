# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
Pewlett Hackard has hired us to provide specific queries giving us insight on the “silver tsunami” as many employees are reaching the retirement age. We look to collect all names of employees at the age of retirement, along with the current positions they hold. In doing this we will evaluate which positions will be effected the most and will need the most upcoming attention.
## Results 
Below is the summary by department of eligible associates for retirement. <br> 
* We see between the Senior Engineers and Staff there are approximately 62,000 employees that are close to retiring.
* These two positons nearly have 15,000 more associates eligible in each, compared to the third ranked position of engineer.<br>

## Summary 
Overall, there are thousands of employees nearing the end of their careers. With this in mind we found that the Senior Staff and Senior Engineers will be hit the hardest in the coming future. The senior engineers will be harder to maintain as there are less elibible Senior Engineers for the mentorship program making it harder to promote internally in the near future. In total there are 72,458 employees close to retiring with a total of 1549 eligible associates for the mentorship program. Pewlett Hackard is going to have a hard time replacing all of the employees about to retire and with the low level of associates eligible for the mentorship program, Pewlett Hackard will need to reach out and evaluate external sources to help them through this tough time. I suggest to evaluate overall department needs further as well as determining average employee tenure at the company to forcast further when everyone will be retiring.
